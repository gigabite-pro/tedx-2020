                    In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, <span>TEDx</span> is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group.
                     These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized (subject to certain rules and regulations).

                    <strong>Amity International school</strong> has been organising TEDx events for 5 years now. Every year, several ground shaking ideas are selected and speakers from several backgrounds give their thoughts and inspire the students through their TEDx talks. This year, the theme is possibility rebooted. Its about turning a Setback into a Comeback.
                     Possibility RebooTED looks for comeback stories of people who were grazed to the ground and yet managed to rise and rebuild their empires and restarted their journey to become who they are today. When you think have hit rock-bottom, remember that there is only room for progress!
